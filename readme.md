# Apex Product Education Platform

Apex is a platform to take your product management skills to the next level. There are three certifications offered, which will help you grow as a product manager.

The landing page gives the user information about the company and the certificates offered. There is a short quiz to test the user's knowledge and suggest the appropriate program to take based on their answers.
